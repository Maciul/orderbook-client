### Crypto Fun: OrderBook Graph 

*What does this service do*? 
- The service makes a request for cumulative order book data. 
- Uses 3rd party Modern Visualization tool [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) to nicely present the data received.
- 3 currentcy pairs to pick from: BTC_ETH, BTC_DOGE_ BTC_LTC.

*Thank you!*
